   - Enable your preferred sign-in methods (e.g., Google Sign-In).

3. **Set Up Firestore Database**:
   - Go to the **Firestore Database** section.
   - Create your database and apply the necessary security rules.

4. **Create Firebase Config File**:
   - Go to project settings in Firebase Console to find your config object.
   - Create a `firebase-config.js` file in your project and paste the config object.

   ```javascript
   import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
   import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
   import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
   
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
   };

   const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
   const auth = getAuth(app);
   const db = getFirestore(app);

   export { auth, db };
